# The plugin needs no playlist or media callbacks (its daemon polls FPP), but
# FPP only registers a plugin's commands/descriptions.json at install time,
# without an fppd restart, when the plugin has a callbacks script declaring at
# least one callback type. Declare "lifecycle" and do nothing with it: the
# daemon is started and stopped by scripts/postStart.sh and scripts/preStop.sh.
